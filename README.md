# FootballManager

This app was my final project for the college class "Programming in Java." It is a desktop app that draws inspiration from the popular game "Football Manager" and the website "Transfermarkt." We used SceneBuilder for designing the screens and H2 was used for designing and creating the database. In the folder titled "DatabaseValues" I included all the values that were in my original database.
